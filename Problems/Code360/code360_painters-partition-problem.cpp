/**
 * Platform: Code360
 * Problem: Painter's Partition Problem
 * Link: https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/painter-s-partition-problem_1089557
 * Difficulty: Moderate
 * Solved: 08-09-2025
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Use Binary Search on answer (minimum time required)
 * - For each mid, check if partitioning into â‰¤ k painters is possible
 * - Narrow down search space until optimal minimum time is found
 *
 * Complexity Analysis:
 * - Time: O(N * log(sum(arr)))   [Binary search with partition check]
 * - Space: O(1)                  [Only variables used for simulation]
